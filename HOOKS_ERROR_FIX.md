# React Hooks Error - Fixed

## Problem
The application was throwing a React error about hooks being called in the wrong order:
```
React has detected a change in the order of Hooks called by Home. 
This will lead to bugs and errors if not fixed.
Error: Rendered more hooks than during the previous render.
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by **violating React's Rules of Hooks**. In both `src/app/page.js` and `src/app/chat/page.js`, the `useState` and `useRef` hooks were being called **after** conditional returns (`if` statements that return JSX).

### What Was Wrong:
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Hooks called AFTER conditional returns
const { data: session, status } = useSession();

useEffect(() => { /* ... */ }, [status, router]);

if (status === "loading") {
  return <div>Loading...</div>;  // Early return
}

if (status === "unauthenticated") {
  return null;  // Early return
}

// These hooks are called AFTER the conditional returns above
const [message, setMessage] = useState("");  // ❌ Wrong!
const fileRef = useRef(null);  // ❌ Wrong!
```

This violates React's fundamental rule: **All hooks must be called in the same order on every render.**

## Solution
Moved all hooks to the top of the component, **before** any conditional returns.

### What's Now Correct:
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - All hooks at the top
const router = useRouter();
const { data: session, status } = useSession();

// ALL state and ref hooks BEFORE any returns
const [message, setMessage] = useState("");
const [uploadedPreview, setUploadedPreview] = useState(null);
const fileRef = useRef(null);

// All useEffect hooks
useEffect(() => {
  if (status === "unauthenticated") {
    router.push("/login");
  }
}, [status, router]);

// NOW conditional returns are safe
if (status === "loading") {
  return <div>Loading...</div>;
}

if (status === "unauthenticated") {
  return null;
}

// Rest of component...
```

## Files Fixed

### 1. `src/app/page.js`
- Moved `useState` hooks to the top (before conditional returns)
- Moved `useRef` hooks to the top
- Kept `useEffect` hooks at the top (they were already correct)
- Conditional returns now come AFTER all hooks

### 2. `src/app/chat/page.js`
- Moved all `useState` hooks to the top
- Moved all `useRef` hooks to the top  
- Moved conditional loading/auth checks to AFTER all `useEffect` hooks
- Now all hooks are called in the same order every render

## React's Rules of Hooks

To prevent this error in the future, always follow these rules:

### ✅ DO:
1. Call hooks at the **top level** of your component
2. Call all hooks **before any conditional returns**
3. Call hooks in the **same order** every time
4. Call hooks only in React function components or custom hooks

### ❌ DON'T:
1. Call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
2. Call hooks after conditional returns
3. Call hooks conditionally (e.g., `if (x) { useState() }`)
4. Call hooks in regular JavaScript functions

## Testing the Fix

After these changes:
1. Save both files
2. The development server should hot-reload automatically
3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
4. You should now be able to:
   - Log in with Google or GitHub
   - Access the home page without errors
   - Navigate to chat without errors
   - See proper loading states
   - No more React hooks errors in console

## Why This Matters

React uses the order of hook calls to maintain state between renders. When you call hooks conditionally or after returns, the order can change between renders, causing React to:
- Lose track of state
- Associate state with the wrong variables
- Crash with errors
- Behave unpredictably

By keeping all hooks at the top level in the same order, React can reliably track and maintain your component's state across re-renders.

## Additional Notes

The profile page (`src/app/profile/page.js`) was already correctly implemented with all hooks at the top, which is why it didn't have this error.
