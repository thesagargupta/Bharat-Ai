# Vercel Deployment Fix - Notification Routes Removed

## Issue
Vercel deployment was failing with this error:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve 'web-push'
./src/app/api/notifications/send/route.js:2:1
```

## Root Cause
When we removed PWA functionality, we:
- ✅ Deleted `web-push` from `package.json`
- ✅ Removed service worker files
- ❌ **BUT forgot to delete the notification API routes** that depended on `web-push`

The notification routes (`src/app/api/notifications/send/route.js` and `subscribe/route.js`) were still importing `web-push`, causing the build to fail.

## Solution
Deleted the unused notification API routes:
- ❌ `src/app/api/notifications/send/route.js`
- ❌ `src/app/api/notifications/subscribe/route.js`

These routes were only used for PWA push notifications, which are no longer needed.

## Changes Made
```bash
# Deleted files
src/app/api/notifications/send/route.js (deleted)
src/app/api/notifications/subscribe/route.js (deleted)

# Committed and pushed
git add -A
git commit -m "Remove notification API routes (no longer needed after PWA removal)"
git push origin main
```

## Verification
✅ Notification routes deleted
✅ Changes committed to git
✅ Changes pushed to GitHub
✅ Vercel will auto-deploy from latest commit

## What This Means
- No more push notifications (these required service workers/PWA)
- Cleaner codebase without unused dependencies
- Successful Vercel deployments
- No breaking changes to existing functionality (chat, image gen, etc.)

## If You Need Push Notifications Again
You would need to:
1. Re-add `web-push` to `package.json`
2. Recreate the notification API routes
3. Re-implement service worker registration
4. Add PWA manifest back

But for now, the app works perfectly without these features.

**Status**: ✅ Fixed
**Date**: October 21, 2025
**Deployment**: Should succeed on next Vercel build
