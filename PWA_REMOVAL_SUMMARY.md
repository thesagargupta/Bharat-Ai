# PWA Removal Summary

## What Was Removed

All Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality has been completely removed from the Bharat AI application to fix cache-related issues.

### Files Deleted:
- ✅ `components/PWAInstallPrompt.js` - PWA installation prompt component
- ✅ `components/ServiceWorkerManager.js` - Service worker manager component
- ✅ `public/sw.js` - Service worker file
- ✅ `public/manifest.json` - PWA manifest
- ✅ `public/offline.html` - Offline fallback page
- ✅ `scripts/inject-version.js` - Build-time version injection script
- ✅ `CACHE_BUSTING_GUIDE.md` - PWA cache busting documentation
- ✅ `CLEAR_CACHE_GUIDE.md` - Cache clearing guide
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment guide with PWA references

### Files Modified:

#### `src/app/layout.js`
- Removed PWAInstallPrompt and ServiceWorkerManager imports and components
- Removed PWA-related meta tags (manifest link, apple-mobile-web-app tags)
- Added ServiceWorkerCleanup component to unregister existing service workers

#### `next.config.mjs`
- Removed service worker headers configuration
- Removed PWA-related experimental settings
- Simplified to only handle image configurations

#### `vercel.json`
- Removed service worker and manifest cache headers
- Kept only security headers

#### `package.json`
- Removed `next-pwa` dependency
- Removed `web-push` dependency
- Removed `prebuild` script (version injection)
- Removed `postbuild` script
- Simplified build commands

#### `src/app/setting/page.js`
- Removed service worker registration code
- Removed push notification subscription logic
- Removed VAPID key handling
- Simplified notification toggle (now client-side only)

### New Files Added:

#### `components/ServiceWorkerCleanup.js`
- New cleanup component that runs on app load
- Unregisters all existing service workers
- Clears all browser caches
- Prevents 404 errors for sw.js

## Why This Was Done

1. **Cache Issues**: The PWA service worker was holding aggressive caches that caused errors
2. **404 Errors**: Browser kept requesting `/sw.js` after it was deleted
3. **Update Problems**: Users weren't getting latest updates due to caching
4. **Complexity**: PWA features added unnecessary complexity for this application

## Result

✅ No more cache-related errors
✅ No more 404 errors for service worker files
✅ Fresh content loads on every visit
✅ Simplified deployment process
✅ All other functionality remains intact

## For Users with Existing Service Workers

The `ServiceWorkerCleanup` component will automatically:
1. Detect any registered service workers on first visit
2. Unregister them completely
3. Clear all cached data
4. Ensure clean browsing experience going forward

## Next Steps

1. Clear your browser cache manually (optional but recommended)
2. The app will automatically clean up service workers on next visit
3. Deploy to production - no special steps needed
